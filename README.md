# haacked/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

It's a blatant rip-off of [holman/feedback](https://github.com/holman/feedback).
But good ideas are meant to be spread.

I like to write about software, open source, GitHub, .NET, and other random
topics at [Haacked.com](http://haacked.com/). If you have a comment on a
specific blog post, please comment over there. If you have a question about
ASP.NET MVC (I still get a lot of those), please ask it on
http://stackoverflow.com/ and tweet me a link and I'll help you get it
answered.

If you have any other questions about any of those topics or me, feel free to
ask it here.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're still better off
if you [ask GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/haacked/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/haacked/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters

Twitter.
